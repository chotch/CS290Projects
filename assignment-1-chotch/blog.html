			<h1> Web Development Code Blog </h1>
			<h2> Assignment 1 - Due October 1st</h2>
			<h3> Challenges/Troubles and how I solved them </h3>
			<p> For me, the main challenge of this assignment was getting used to using a new language along with new tools such as GitHub. Previously, I had never done any web development and had never worked with html before so these things were new to me. I solved this challenge by being patient with myself and understanding that I will probably make some minor mistakes at first, which ultimately helped me learn the new tools that I will work with throughout the term. </p>
			<h3> What I learned from this assignment and what I already knew </h3>
			<p> Prety much everything in this assignment was new for me. I had never worked in html before and I had heard of GitHub, but never really used it. I already knew how to use my text editor from last year in CS 162, but I think there are more effective text editors out there that I may attempt to work with on future assignments. I think the most important things I learned from this assignment was learning how to work with the engineering server to publish something on the web for everyone to see. I found this very cool and look forward seeing my websites' progress. </p>
			<h3> Helpful resources and how I used them </h3> 
			<p> I think this assignment was very straight forward and I did not need to use any outside resources while completing it. The notes from class were very helpful to ensure I had the correct syntax on my html code and git commands. Other than my notes, I followed the directions for assignment 1 carefully and made sure to complete every step. </p>

			<h2> Assignment 2 - Due October 15th </h2>
			<h3> Challenges/Troubles and how I solved them </h3>
			<p> My biggest trouble on this assignment was getting started. I waited October 13th to start which I will definitely not do again. The first few steps were hard because I did not really know how to start modifying the webpage. I decided to start with the mouseover effects and then moved on to stylizing the header and filter section before moving on to the main content. I think beginning with the small details was helpful because it allowed me to see progress in my work early on, which is always reassuring. </p>
			<h3> What I learned </h3>
			<p> I think the biggest insight from this assignment was that I realized the potential of using CSS. The index.html file started as a very bland webpage that had little meaning and was not engaging. Through using some simple CSS, I was able to transform the same content into a much more interactive and interesting webpage, which I think is a very cool skill to have. </p>
			<h3> Helpful Resources </h3>
			<p> For me, the most helpful resources for this assignment were my class notes and piazza. I discovered that a lot of students had similar issues as me, which was trying to figure out the grid shaped layout of the main content. After looking around piazza and reading some of the discussion, I got much more confident with my plan of action. </p>	
			<h3> Things I had to Google </h3>
			<p> The things I had to google for this assignment were related to block versus flex elements. After reading some of the piazza disucssions, it seemed like most people were using inline-flex, although my initial thought was to use inline-block. From here, I decided to Google what the differences were and realized that I think I could complete this assignment with using inline block display type. The other thing I had to Google was dealing with font colors and mouseover effects. I did not remember the exact keywords that were used to complete these tasks. </p>


			<h2> Assignment 3 - Due November 5th </h2>
			<h3> Challenges and how I solved them </h3>
			<p> My biggest trouble on this assignment was accessing the data-condition attirbute within a the post element in the html. I kind of forgot that attributes existed and I was very stuck on how to store the condition of a post in a variable. After looking through notes, I finally remembered that attributes existed, and simply called a getAttribute function on the element variable, which returned the text content of the specified attribute </p>
			<h3> What did I learn and what were some insights </h3>
			<p> Overall, I thought I learned a ton from this assignment. When designing web pages, it seems to me like the true essence and power of web application comes from the javascript. The html and css allow for a cool looking page, but without javascript, the page seems close to useless and there is very little potential for user interaction. I really liked this assignment and I thought a learned a lot of useful skills that I will use in the future. </p>
			<h3> What resources did I use </h3>
			<p> The main resources I used on this assignment were my class notes and google. I often referenced my class notes in the beginning of working on this assignment to familiarize myself with the syntax and commands used to grab elements from the document or to specify classLists and attributes. Once I was familiar with these commands, I used google to look up more specific functions. For example, I looked up how to use the substring function and also browsed the internet for a function that would allow me to ignore case when working on implementing the filter text description. I looked at Piazza alot on assignment 2, but I never looked at it for this assignment. </p>
			<h3> One or two things that I had to google </h3>
			<p> One thing I googled for this assignment was looking at how the alert() function works. In the assignment description, we were instructed to use this function, but I didn't really know if it required parameters or how it worked. I googled alert() javascript, and read a little bit about it. Another thing I googled was how to retrieve an attribute from a specific variable storing an element from the document body. Each posts contained a few attributes that stored the city, price, and condition, and I was very confused on how to grab these values initially. With the help of the internet, I quickly found out how to use a few functions that allowed me to store the content of an attribute in a javascript variable. </p>
